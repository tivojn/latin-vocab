# Latin Vocabulary App (Static Version)

This is a static version of the Latin Vocabulary Learning app that works entirely in the browser without requiring a server. This makes it perfect for hosting on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.

## Features

- Multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank exercises
- Three chapters of Latin vocabulary
- Example sentences for context
- Score tracking during practice sessions

## How It Works

This version embeds all vocabulary data directly in the JavaScript file, eliminating the need for server-side code. The app functions entirely on the client side with:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for functionality and data

## Limitations Compared to Full Version

This static version has some limitations compared to the full server-based version:

- No user accounts or persistent progress tracking
- Vocabulary data is fixed and cannot be updated without changing the code
- No "weak words" practice mode based on past performance

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to use the application. No installation or setup required.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file
- `styles.css` - CSS styles
- `app.js` - JavaScript with embedded vocabulary data and application logic
